Add hosted background videos to your Visual Composer rows, with optional coloured or patterned overlays. Built and maintained by BG Stock.

== Description ==

*Note this plugin doesn't work with the latest version of Visual Composer. It remains here for reference and for people using older versions of Visual Composer.*

Background Videos for Visual Composer gives you the ability to add background videos to any Visual Composer row.

Each row allows you to specify mp4, webm and/or ogg video files to be used as a background. You can optionally add a semi-transparent overlay of a solid colour or a pre-defined pattern.

Other provided options include:

* Add pause/play button
* Auto-pause after (time in seconds)
* Poster / fallback image
* Pause/play button position
* Overlay opacity

Background Videos for Visual Composer is developed and maintained by the [BG Stock](https://html5backgroundvideos.com) team.

== Installation ==

Search for 'Background Videos for Visual Composer' on WordPress' 'Add Plugin' screen and install from there, or:

1. Upload `background-videos-for-vc` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which video file types should I use? =

We recommend using at least mp4 and webm. We recommend [this video converter](https://html5backgroundvideos.com/converter/) to convert your video to the required file types.

= Where do I add the background video? =

Edit any row in Visual Composer, and you'll see a tab called 'Row Background Video'. All of the plugin options are contained therein.

= The Visual Composer front-end editor doesn't update the video! =

This is due to us having to use a workaround to insert the video tag into Visual Composer's default [vc_row] shortcode. Rest assured if you save and refresh the page, you *will* see your new video.

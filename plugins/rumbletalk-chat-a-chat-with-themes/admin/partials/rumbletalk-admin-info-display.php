                <b>My chat height is too small, how can I adjust it?</b>
                <p>
                    RumbleTalk chat room is elastic and can expand to any size (even Tv & big screens).
                    <br>
                    Please add a constant width and height to the chat configuration (above).

                <b>Seems like my theme is not working with RumbleTalk plugin?</b>
                <p>
                    This is not so common, but if you run into issues with the plugin, you may want to try a direct
                    embed.
                </p>
                To do it: disable the RumbleTalk WordPress plugin and use a full chat code as shown in the RumbleTalk
                administration panel.
                <br>
                (we supplied it below for ease)
                <br>
                <code>
                    <?= htmlspecialchars(RumbleTalk::embed(array('display_only' => true))) ?>
                </code>
            </li>

                <b>I want my users to login with their member's credentials, but I see "Private Chat Room" message</b>
                <p>
                    A. Click on the members checkbox in the plugin. <br/>
                    B. Then open the chat settings, verify that "allow guests" is checked. This should allow users to
                    automatically login.
                    Note, this does not mean that guests can login to the chat.

                    I want my users to login with their member's credentials, Do I need to add them manually to the

                </b>
                <p>
                    You do not need to add users manually to make them auto login.
                    However, you do need to add your administrators.
                    <br>
                    Tip: Create a user with the same login name in your system to make it easier for the user to login.

            <h4 class="rt-color">WordPress Hosted</h4>
            If your website is hosted by WordPress, you will not be able to use RumbleTalk :-(
            <br>
            That's because WordPress prevents 3rd party widgets to be included in their <b>hosted</b> version.
